# SM-Cashier
As former 3rd Level Supporter at GK Software SE the first project in PythonX was a bit familiar to me. It is far away from perfect but the GUI works.
Logic is written in Python and the GUI is Tinkter. Feel free to add functionality like VAT.

Just start with <python3 cashier.py> . Make sure that Tk is installed. I will later add a bash script that starts a virtual enviroment(to protect Your base system)  and installs the dependencies.
The command to start the script is > <bash cashier.sh> . Afterclosing the GUI the venv is deactivated and You can go on as usual.
