As former 3rd Level Supporter at GK Software SE the first project in PythonX was a bit familiar to me. It is far away from perfect but the GUI works and the project Supermarket Cashier is extensible in any direction..
Logic is written in Python and the GUI is Tinkter. All crossplatform made. Pi 4B ready with free open source OSs.
